You can find the live version of this project at: http://smoking-rooster.appspot.com/

To run this code, you must first have the [Google App Engine SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) installed.

__Note__: You will need a secret key in a file secret.py

Then you can either run the application through the GAE Launcher GUI
  - File -> Add Existing Application
  - Add project
  - Click Browse
  
or through the command line
  - Navigate to project directory
  - Run `dev_appserver.py ./`

__Note__: This assumes you have symlinks for GAE commands installed. If you don't, open the GAE Launcher and you will be prompted to install them.
